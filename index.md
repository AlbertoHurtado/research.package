Research Package is a Flutter package for creating surveys and obtaining informed consent containing models, UI elements and screens. 
The motivation is coming from two similar native libraries [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) on Android and [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) on iOS.

The main modules of the above mentioned libraries are which are also the main features of Research Package:
- Consent - [How it's done in ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/InformedConsent/InformedConsent.html) - Implemented in RP
- Survey - [How it's done in ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/Survey/CreatingSurveys.html) - Implemented in RP
- Active Task - [How it's done in ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/ActiveTasks/ActiveTasks.html) - Can be implemented later with the help of flutter [plugins](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins) by CACHET.

## Getting Started

Research Package is published to Pub: [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/research_package.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/research_package) 

You can start using it by adding it to your dependencies.

After you run `flutter packages get` command you are able to import and start using Research Package. 
You can import the whole package including the Model and UI libraries:

```dart
import 'package:research_package/research_package.dart';
```

Or with the following lines you can decide which library of the package you want to gain access to:

``` dart
import 'package:research_package/model.dart';
import 'package:research_package/ui.dart';
```

Remember, that objects starting with `RP` are part of the Model (like `RPConsentDocument`) while those which start with `RPUI` are part of the UI library (like `RPUIVisualConsentStep`).

## Documentation

Visit the website of the project at [researchpackage.org](https://www.researchpackage.org) for more information and tutorials.

You can find the API documentation generated for pub [here](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/).

## Example application

To get an overview of Research Package's features have a look at the example application [here](https://pub.dev/packages/research_package#-example-tab-).

## Similarity to ResearchKit and ResearchStack

Research Package is clearly similar to these two existent framework. A goal with the package was to help developers enjoy the same features with Flutter's cross-platform framework. 
The names, functionalities and most of the logic are similar or identical to the previously mentioned two framework. This way we believe that the transition for those who have used them before will be easier and smoother.

## Current stage

The project is work in progress. New Answer Formats are being added to the survey module of the framework constanly. 
The available Answer Formats are the following at the moment:
- Single Choice
- Multiple Choice
- Integer

## Use Cases

One of the goals for the package was to make it capable of handling a [WHO5](https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/Documents/WHO5_English.pdf) survey. As an example at this point Research Package can obtain the informed consent from the participant, show the WHO5 survey questions and collect the results.

## Who is backing this project?

Research Package is made by [CACHET - Copenhagen Center for Health Technology](http://www.cachet.dk/).

## How can I contribute?

## Useful Links
In order to familiarize with the framework and potentially extend it, it might worth to have a look at these links about Research Kit and Research Stack.

You can get a good understading of the flow and the basic concepts.
Also there's a useful presentation of the different AnswerFormats.
