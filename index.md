Welcome to the Research Package wiki!

Research Package is a cross platform Flutter package and UX framework for building research study applications.

The package currently has **two main features**:

- Obtaining informed consent
- Creating survey and collecting answers

The Research Package is trying to follow the object hierarchy and naming of Apple's [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) and [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) for Android to make the transition from those libraries as smooth as possible.
