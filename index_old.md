Research Package is a cross platform Flutter package and UX framework for building research study applications.

It is for creating surveys and obtaining informed consent containing models, UI elements and screens. 
The motivation is coming from two similar native libraries ResearchStack on Android and ResearchKit on iOS.

The package currently has **two main features**:

- Obtaining informed consent
- Creating survey and collecting answers

The Research Package is trying to follow the object hierarchy and naming of Apple's [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) and [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) for Android to make the transition from those libraries as smooth as possible.
