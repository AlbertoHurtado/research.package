# research_package

This is a Flutter package implementing support for surveys like [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) and [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/).

## Current stage

Currently we are designing and implementing the domain model for ResearchPackage.
The package tries to follow the [ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) and [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) patterns and namings.

## Challenges

[ResearchStack](http://researchstack.org/) and [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org/) are built on native iOS and Android which have totally different architecture than the Widget-based [Flutter](flutter.io).


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
